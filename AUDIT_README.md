# Documentation Audit Report 

## Overview
This audit reviewed the documentation for the `requestWithRetry` utility against its source code implementation to identify factual discrepancies.

## What Was Audited
- **Documentation File:** readme.md
- **Source Code File:** input.ts
- **Focus:** Parameter descriptions, value ranges, default values, and example code

## Audit Findings
**Total Issues Found: 3** (All High Severity)

### Issue Categories
- **Value Range Errors:** Documentation claims 0–10, code enforces 1–5
- **Default Value Errors:** Documentation claims default is 1, code uses default 3
- **Example Code Errors:** Example uses invalid value that causes runtime error

## How Citations Were Derived

### Documentation Review
- Read readme.md Configuration table for parameter descriptions
- Extracted exact quoted text from the documentation
- Identified the range and default value claims

### Code Review
- Examined input.ts JSDoc comments for authoritative parameter constraints
- Reviewed the `requestWithRetry` function implementation
- Located runtime validation logic that enforces constraints
- Verified default value assignment via nullish coalescing operator

### Verification Method
Each issue was verified by comparing:
1. What documentation **claims** the parameter should accept
2. What the **code actually validates** (enforces at runtime)
3. Where the code **actually sets defaults**

## Files Generated

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| report.json | Structured issue report with all details |
| citations.md | Side-by-side comparison with exact code references |
| README_backup.md | Unchanged copy of original documentation |
| README.md | Corrected documentation matching code behavior |
| AUDIT_README.md | This file - explanation of audit process |

## How to Verify Correctness

### For Each Issue:
1. Open **input.ts** and locate the code citation (line numbers provided)
2. Open **citations.md** and review the side-by-side comparison
3. Verify the code validation/default matches what citations.md describes
4. Confirm the corrected README.md now matches the code exactly

### Example Verification for Issue 1:
- Check input.ts lines 17-19: The validation enforces `retryCount` must be 1–5
- Check citations.md: Shows documentation claimed 0–10 (incorrect)
- Check corrected README.md: Now states 1–5 (correct)

## Key Findings

All three issues are **High Severity** because they create immediate, breaking problems:
- ❌ Users trusting the documented range would write code that crashes
- ❌ Users relying on the documented default get wrong behavior
- ❌ Users copying the example code get immediate runtime errors

## Audit Conclusion
The original documentation contained **factual errors in three critical areas**. The corrected README.md now precisely matches the code implementation.
